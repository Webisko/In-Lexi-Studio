**1.What photography services do you offer?**

I provide three main photography services:

* Wedding Photography - I capture your special day with a blend of candid moments and posed portraits, documenting everything from getting ready to the first dance. My approach focuses on telling your unique love story through natural, authentic images that you'll treasure forever.

* Portrait & Headshot Photography - Whether you need professional headshots for business, LinkedIn, or acting portfolios, or personal portraits for family occasions, I create polished images that showcase your personality and professionalism. Sessions can be done in-studio or on location of you choice. For your comfort and peace of mind I can drive to any assigned location with all the studio equipment.

* Product & Promotional Photography - I help businesses showcase their products and campaigns through high-quality commercial photography. This includes product shots for e-commerce, marketing materials, social media content, and promotional campaigns that help your brand stand out.

(Each service includes pre-shoot consultation, professional editing, and delivery of high-resolution images. I work closely with clients to understand their vision and ensure the final results exceed expectations. Would you like more details about any of these services or pricing information?)

3. **How far in advance should I book my photography session and what 	is your booking 	process?**

I recommend booking as soon as possible since dates are filling quickly and I maintain a limited number of spots to ensure quality service for each client.

To secure your date, simply reach out through my \[contact form\] and we'll discuss your needs, check availability, and finalize your booking with a signed contract and retainer. The sooner you book, the better your chances of securing your preferred date\!

**3a.When should I book and how does your scheduling work?**

Honestly, the sooner the better\! My calendar fills up fast and I only take on a certain number of clients each month so I can give everyone my full attention.

5. **What happens if I wait to book?** 

My calendar fills months in advance, especially for popular wedding dates and seasons. The longer you wait, the less likely your preferred date will be available. I recommend reaching out even if you're just considering it \- I can hold your date with a small deposit while you finalize details.

6. **Can you show me recent work from sessions like mine?**

Absolutely\! I love sharing recent galleries that match what you're looking for. \[Contact me here\] with details about your event or session, and I'll send you a personalized portfolio of similar work. This also gives us a chance to discuss your specific needs and availability.
