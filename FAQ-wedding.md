**FAMILY AND GROUP PHOTOS **  
	We find that nearly every client wants at least a few of these, and of course we see taking them 	as a normal part of the day. We recommend keeping the number of group photos within bounds \- 	we find somewhere around 7 is a good number to aim for, so that this aspect of the photography 	doesn't take over the day. Before your wedding, we'll send you a guide of different ways that you 	might do group photos to make sure you get what you want.

**WHEN WILL WE GET OUR PHOTOS** 

**SECOND PHOTOGRAPHER **  
There is always a freshness and variety to having two visions, and the ability to be in two places at once is every photographer's dream\! Having two photographers has many advantages. It also means we will move around less \- for example, during a ceremony we have two viewpoints without moving, which means we can be less obtrusive.
